# HW2: kNN - Conceptual Questions

**Name:** [Your Name Here]

**Instructions:** Answer each question thoughtfully in 2-4 sentences. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of the mathematical concepts and practical implications. Some questions may require research or deeper thinking beyond the basic implementation.

## Conceptual questions

1. The kNN algorithm is what is known as a "non-parametric" learning algorithm. Why?
   Answer:

2. What does the algorithm do when k=1? What about when k=N, where N is the size of the dataset? Briefly describe how varying k changes the resulting model.
   Answer:

3. What could happen if you are trying to train a kNN classififer on a dataset that has 9500 points labeled 0 and 500 points labeled 1?
   Answer:

4. What is the curse of dimensionality and why does it affect the performance of kNN? What can we do to mitigate it?
   Answer:

5. Come up with 1 real-world problem that you might use kNN to solve. Come up with one where you think kNN would not work well.
   Answer:

6. What is a decision boundary? How does kNN "create" them?
   Answer:
