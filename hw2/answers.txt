Q1. K-NN Algorithm Basics
   a) Explain why K-NN might be called a "lazy learning" algorithm.

   Answer:


   b) What does "instance-based learning" mean in the context of K-NN?

   Answer:


Q2. Distance Metrics
   a) When would you choose Manhattan distance over Euclidean distance?

   Answer:


   b) Give a real-world example where Minkowski distance with p=3 might be more appropriate than p=1 or p=2.

Q3. The effects of different choices of K
   a) What happens to the model's behavior as K gets very large (approaching the size of the training set)?

   Answer:


   b) What happens when K=1? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

   Answer:


   c) Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in K-NN as K changes.
