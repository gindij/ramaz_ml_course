MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS
=============================================================================

Q1. Normal Equation vs Gradient Descent
   a) Explain the key mathematical difference between the normal equation and gradient descent approaches to solving linear regression.

   Answer:


   b) Why can we use the normal equation for linear regression but not for logistic regression or neural networks?

   Answer:


Q2. Matrix Operations
   a) In the normal equation θ = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y, what happens if X^T X is not invertible? Give a practical example when this might occur.

   Answer:


   b) Explain why we need to add an intercept term (bias) to our feature matrix, and how this affects the normal equation.

Q3. Polynomial Features
   a) How does adding polynomial features change the fundamental nature of our linear regression model? Is it still "linear"?

   Answer:


   b) What is the main risk of using high-degree polynomial features, and how might you detect this problem?

   Answer:


Q4. Feature Scaling
   a) Why is standardizing features often crucial when using polynomial features, but less critical for simple linear regression?

   Answer:


   b) Give an example of a real-world dataset where you would definitely need to standardize features before applying linear regression.

Q5. R-squared Interpretation
   a) What does an R² value of 0.85 tell you about your model? What about R² = 0.0 or R² = -0.5?

   Answer:


   b) Can R² ever be greater than 1? Explain why or why not.

   Answer:


Q6. Cross-Validation
   a) Why might a model that achieves perfect R² = 1.0 on training data perform poorly on test data?

   Answer:


   b) In k-fold cross-validation, how do you choose the value of k, and what are the trade-offs?

Q9. Assumptions of Linear Regression
    a) What are the key assumptions underlying linear regression, and what happens when they're violated?

    Answer:
