## Questions
### Linear regression
1. Look up Anscombe's quartet. What is it, and what does it teach us about relying on models without examining the underlying data?
   Answer:

2. In what sense is linear regression a "linear" model?
   Answer:

3. If y is very skewed, what might happen to the line the model learns? How can we try to mitigate this?
   Answer:

4. Intuitively explain what it means for a coefficient in a linear regression model to be positive or negative.
   Answer:

5. Intuitively explain what the intercept learned by a linear regression model represents.
   Answer:

6. Given a dataset that contains features X and a response y, what types of data analysis might you do to determine whether or not linear regression is an appropriate algorithm to use?
   Answer:

7. Both linear and logistic regression are called ‘regression’ models. How are they similar, and how are they different in what they predict?
   Answer:

### Logistic regression
1. What about linear regression makes it unsuitable for classification problems where the response y is binary (1 or 0)?
   Answer:

2. What is model calibration? Given a bunch of x values, their predictions yhat, and true labels y, what is a visual way we can understand where a model is well-calibrated?
   Answer:

3. Why is it useful to predict a probability rather than just a binary label? What extra information do we get from a probability?
   Answer:
